## Description
This project aims to covert music into imagery. Both sound and light are made up of waves. '
These waves vibrate at very different frequencies but they can be related by a conversion factor.
Hopefully this code can generate images as beautiful as the music sent through it.
> Music is the strongest form of magic.

### Hypothetical Module
I plan to add a module about how to sucessfully work as a team on a project.
